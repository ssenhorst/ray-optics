/**
 * @file `src/core/illustration.js` defines the scene-level `illustration` property, which draws a
 * picture at the object and another at the image an optical system forms of it.
 *
 * Ray diagrams say where an image is, but not what it looks like. Showing a recognisable picture,
 * scaled and flipped by the magnification the simulation actually produces, makes the size and the
 * orientation of the image immediate in a way that two converging points do not.
 *
 * The object is located by two light sources, named as `top` and `bottom`. The image is located by
 * two goals of the task, named in `imageGoals`, whose measured convergence points give where those
 * two ends of the object are imaged — so the picture follows the simulation rather than any
 * assumption about the optics.
